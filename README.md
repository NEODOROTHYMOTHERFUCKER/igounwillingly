***before you interact***

🌧️ - i have severe social anxiety so I might not respond if you talk to me directly, it's nothing personal so please don't feel bad !

🌧️ - staring (especially quietly !!!) makes me really anxious, i'll probably move away if i don't know you too well :[

🌧️ - sometimes i fall asleep while playing (i use an autoclicker) ' -' 

🌧️ - i don't have any DNIs or strict rules, just be a decent person ;;


tw// medical stuff  

🌧️ - i have heart problems so i'll need to get away from people for a while if i'm too anxious/overwhelmed :( 
please respect my space if this happens
