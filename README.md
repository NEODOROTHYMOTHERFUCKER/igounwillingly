***before you interact***

🌧️ - i have severe social anxiety so I might not respond if you talk to me directly, it's nothing personal so don't feel bad 

🌧️ - staring makes me really anxious, i'll probably move away if i don't know you too well 

🌧️ - sometimes i fall asleep while playing [i use an autoclicker]  

🌧️ - i don't have any DNIs or strict rules, just be a decent person
